# Large Fibonacci Number Calculator

This is a C program that calculates large Fibonacci numbers with up to 1024 digits. It handles numbers too big for standard data types by using a custom structure.
# How It Works
The program stores Fibonacci numbers as arrays of digits (characters) and uses custom logic to add them together, simulating large number arithmetic.
